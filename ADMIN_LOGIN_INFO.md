// pages/api/admin-login.ts (This would be an API route for admin login)
// Since we're using Next.js App Router, this would be in app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts

// For now, here are the default admin credentials you can use:
/*
Admin Credentials:
- Email: admin@luxeleather.com
- Password: Admin@123

Or you can use Google OAuth if configured.

To access the admin panel:
1. Sign in with admin credentials
2. Navigate to /admin
3. You'll see the admin dashboard with product management, order management, etc.
